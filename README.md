# Interval-Singer
A simple ear training application where the user is prompted to sing a given musical interval.
A refernce pitch is given for those without perfect pitch.
Humming the pitch rather than singing seems to increase the detection accuracy. Otherwise, the 3rd partial (the perfect 5th) tends to get picked up by the FFT algorithm.
